    Hi!
  </div>
  <div>
    Welcome to our second experiment/play session!
  </div>
  <div>By the end of this workshop, you'll have done the following things:
    <ul>
      <li>Responded to a series of exercises about Colour</li>
      <li>Responded to a series of exercises about Graphic Elements</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>Don't worry about trying to complete all the exercises in the next hour or day. You'll get more out of these workshops the more you put in. Try to get into a routine of attempting one or two a day?
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's start with the series of exercises about Colour for the first 30 minutes. Don't forget to keep the <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/">p5.js reference open</a> for syntax (the order of things) tips. Take a screen grab for later study perhaps?
  </div>
  <div>For the last 30 minutes, let's take a look at the Graphic Elements exercises - remember that it's fine to work in threes/groups on this. Remember, you won't be able to complete all the exercises with the knowledge you have now, so it's fine to pick and choose. However, I'd REALLY recommmend working your way through all the exercises during the rest of Block 1 - you will be in a brilliant position if you complete them all. Message me on Slack if you want advice on how to find a copy of the book.

  <div>
    Thanks! <br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
