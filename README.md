Benelia Salmon is the Academic Support Librarian for CCI: [b.salmon@arts.ac.uk](mailto:b.salmon@arts.ac.uk). Please contact her at the email address above if you have any questions regarding library resources or if you wish to book a one-to-one session on library information and research skills. You can find more information on CCI specific library resources in your [Creative Computing Institute subject guide](https://arts.ac.libguides.com/CCI).
- LinkedIn Learning (formally Lynda.com) is also a great resource for learning software packages, coding or even 3D tools like Blender. You can find a link to LinkedIn Learning on <https://canvas.arts.ac.uk/>.
- <https://wiki.cci.arts.ac.uk/> is the Wiki for all of CCI, lots of resources and tutorial there about equipment, software and content on Physical Computing, Creative Code and Digital Making.

## Code of Conduct

You can find the UAL Disciplinary Code For Students here: [Disciplinary Code For Students](https://www.arts.ac.uk/study-at-ual/academic-regulations/student-regulations/disciplinary-code-for-students).

You can find our code of conduct here: [code_of_conduct.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), it was cloned from [https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](the p5.js code of conduct).

[Golan Levin](https://www.flong.com/) also offers a useful thought from his children's school:

> When communicating, ask yourself:
>
> - T – is it True?
> - H – is it Helpful?
> - I – is it Inspiring?
> - N – is it Necessary?
> - K – is it Kind?

## Block/Term Structure

The [Diploma in Creative Computing](https://www.arts.ac.uk/subjects/creative-computing/undergraduate/ual-creative-computing-institute-diploma) is split into two blocks of teaching. **Block 1** takes up the entire Autumn term and half of the Spring term. **Block 2** follows on, taking the second half of Spring term and the entire Summer term.

**Block 1** consists of three units:

- Unit 1: Creative Coding and Creative Computing Frameworks 
- Unit 2: Introducing Computational Futures and Artificial Intelligence 
- Unit 3: Creative Practice: Visual Coding and Physical Computing 

**Block 2** consists of three units:

- Unit 4: Creative Coding: Critical Infrastructures 
- Unit 5: Working and the Digital Creative Industries 
- Unit 6: Creative Practice: Computational Environments 

## Learning Outcomes and platforms for doing so

Please read [UAL's guidance for students on how they will be assessed](https://www.arts.ac.uk/study-at-ual/academic-regulations/course-regulations/assessment). [TLDR](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=TLDR): you will be assessed on the following 5 assessment criteria (quoting from [UAL's page](https://www.arts.ac.uk/study-at-ual/academic-regulations/course-regulations/assessment) - I REALLY recommend watching the video here if you haven't already):

1. **Enquiry**
   - Enquiry is about active learning and reflection. It’s how you explore, research and learn about your subject. Enquiry is central to all creative learning at UAL.
2. **Knowledge**
   - Knowledge is about gathering information and enhancing understanding. It’s how you inform your work, explore diverse cultures and connections and appreciate what you do in a wider context.
3. **Process**
   - Process is about your journey of learning. It’s how you take risks and experiment. And how you keep the creative momentum going — developing ideas from start to finish.
4. **Communication**
   - Communication is about telling the story of your learning and making. It’s how you share your learning with an audience, presenting and explaining your work to different people.
5. **Realisation**
   - Realisation is about the work you create and how this reveals what you’ve learned. It’s taking a look back and evaluating the work you’ve produced.

N.B. The Diploma is assessed to [Level 5 Assessment Criteria Descriptors](https://www.arts.ac.uk/study-at-ual/academic-regulations/course-regulations/assessment) - see the link to the PDF at the bottom of this page.

### Unit Learning Objectives

| No  | Outcome                                                               |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | 
| LO1 | Understand how machine learning works in practice (Knowledge, Process)| 
| LO2 | Understand Artificial Intelligence as a cultural concept (Enquiry)    |
| L03 | Critically discuss computational futures (Enquiry, Communication)     |


## Assessment

Assessment for this unit is a 2000-3500 word essay, due **30th January 2023.**

You will be supplied a list of 10 prompts relating to the material we have covered this term, and will be expected to explore one with respect to a specific machine learning model and sociotechnical system. 

Individual tutorials and group technical workshops will be held after winter break to help you develop your draft. 


# Unit Schedule

## Week 1: Machines, Materials and Metaphors (28/09)

### Summary 

This week introduces students to the aims of the unit, giving them an insight into the themes they will cover and the tools they will use. 

Students will learn about the the relationship between AI and machine learning, contemporary creative uses of AI and critically explore the role of machine learning in society. No preparation is required for this class.
